# WeatherApp
🌤️ Exciting news! I've just created a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the Rapid Weather API. Now, you can stay updated with the latest weather information for any city! ☀️⛅🌦️🌧️❄️

With this app, you can easily check the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more, simply by entering the name of your desired city. It's a handy tool to help you plan your activities and stay prepared for any weather changes.

I'm thrilled to share my latest project with you, showcasing my skills in web development and integrating APIs. It was an exciting journey to build this weather app and make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
